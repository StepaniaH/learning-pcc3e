This repository contains my personal learning journey through the book "Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition" by Eric Matthes. It includes all the code I've typed while working through the exercises and projects in the book.

## Contents

- **Part 1: Basics** (Chapters 1-11)
  - Exercise solutions for each chapter
- **Part 2: Projects** (Chapters 12-20)
  - Learning code and exercise solutions
  - Project implementations

## Status

Most of the content is complete, with the following exceptions:

1. **Alien Invasion Project**: The side-scrolling shooter part is currently on hold. I plan to revisit and complete this after studying "Object-Oriented Python: Master OOP by Building Games and GUIs" to gain a better understanding of OOP and the Pygame library.

2. **Web Application Project**: The front-end programming and deployment sections in Chapter 20 are pending. I will complete the front-end part after verifying my skills through freeCodeCamp's front-end course. The deployment section will be addressed when time permits, leveraging my existing knowledge of blog deployment.

Please note that all code in this repository is personally typed and may not be entirely correct, standardized, or optimized. It has undergone only minimal personal testing.

## Purpose

This repository is intended to help fellow Python beginners who might be struggling with exercises from "Python Crash Course". However, I strongly encourage purchasing the official book for a comprehensive learning experience.
